<!-- 
  Note to self on the modifications that I made:
  - The original default layout was from the https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman repository in _layouts/default.html
    - This means the comparisons will be based off of that document from that repo.
  - Removed the google analytics portion
  - Removed any of the elements in the <head> that I personally was not familiar with 
    - Specifically, the <link> tags for preconnect and preload
  - Removed the "skip-to-content" link
  - Removed the "View on Github" and "Download *" links and replaced them with links to my Github accounts
  - Removed some extraneous information from the footer (i.e., the site-footer-owner class)

  That should be it. I included these notes just in case I plan on changing the layout for new information.
