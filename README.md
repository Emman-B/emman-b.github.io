# Hello, I'm Emmanuel Butor

Welcome to my temporary portfolio (I plan on having a much better looking portfolio in the future).

## About Me
I like to program things for fun, whether they are simple web apps or full games in Unity.

Programming Languages I've worked with:
* C/C++
* C#
* Javascript
* Python
* Java

Other things I've worked with:
* Unity: Game Development
* React: Web App Development
* PERN Stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Nodejs for Full-Stack Web Development



You can find my work on Github on either my personal account, [Emman-B](https://github.com/emman-b), or my school account [ebutor](https://github.com/ebutor).

## Projects
* **D&D DM Toolset** (Github: https://github.com/matthewfritsch/DND-DM-Toolset)
> This is a toolset developed in Unity for Dungeons & Dragons, designed to assist Dungeon Masters. I was one of the key developers working on implementing functionality for some of the components, such as the component for searching for and selecting from a list of monsters.

* **Together in Spirit** (Game link: https://togetherinspirit.itch.io/) (Github: https://github.com/dyzhang16/CS170Project)
> This is a narrative-driven game built in Unity. My role in this project was programmer for the team, and I worked on some of the game system functionality as well as helped with incorporating finalized assets (from other departments) into the game. Examples of things I worked on were the Basketball minigame, Coffee Recipe Book functionality, and some of the cutscnees.

<br>

* **GBF Spark Calculator** (Link to tool: https://emman-b.github.io/gbf-sparks/) (Github: https://github.com/Emman-B/gbf-sparks)
> This is a tool for calculating "sparks" in the mobile game Granblue Fantasy. I was the sole developer of this tool. The tool was developed by writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript by hand (i.e., without any other frameworks) for the purpose of brushing up on the aforementioned programming languages.

<br>

* **Random Tools** (Link to tool: https://emman-b.github.io/random-tools/) (Github: https://github.com/Emman-B/random-tools)
> This is a web app that contains a few tools for randomization (e.g., generating a random number, randomizing a list of items). I was the sole developer of this web app. The main technologies I used to develop this are React with the Material-UI package.
