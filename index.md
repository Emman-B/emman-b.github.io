* C/C++
* C#
* Javascript
* Python
* Java

* Unity: Game Development
* React: Web App Development
* PERN Stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Nodejs for Full-Stack Web Development



## Projects
* **D&D DM Toolset** (Github: <https://github.com/matthewfritsch/DND-DM-Toolset>)
    - Technologies Used: Unity, Git, NUnit Testing (integrated with Unity)
> This is a toolset developed in Unity for Dungeons & Dragons, designed to assist Dungeon Masters. I was one of the key developers working on implementing functionality for some of the components, such as the component for searching for and selecting from a list of monsters. During the development of this software, I was on a team that practiced the Scrum project management framework.

* **Together in Spirit** (Game link: <https://togetherinspirit.itch.io/>) (Github: <https://github.com/dyzhang16/CS170Project>)
    - Technologies Used: Unity, Git
> This is a narrative-driven game built in Unity. My role in this project was programmer for the team, and I worked on some of the game system functionality as well as helped with incorporating finalized assets (from other departments) into the game. Examples of things I worked on were the Basketball minigame, Coffee Recipe Book functionality, and some of the cutscenes.

<br>

* **stage_fright** (Github: <https://github.com/jnkrupp/stage-fright>) (Devpost: <https://devpost.com/software/stage_fright>)
    - Technologies Used: Unity, Git
> This was an entry in the CruzHacks 2019 Hackathon where we devloped an app to help with alleviating stage fright during public speaking. My role with this project was developing the VR space to simulate speaking in front of a live audience. This entry won a few of the awards in the hackathon ("Tech Cares" and "UCSC Arts").

<br>

* **GBF Spark Calculator** (Link to tool: <https://emman-b.github.io/gbf-sparks/>) (Github: <https://github.com/Emman-B/gbf-sparks>)
    - Technologies Used: HTML/CSS/JS, Git
> This is a tool for calculating "sparks" in the mobile game Granblue Fantasy. I was the sole developer of this tool. The tool was developed by writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript by hand (i.e., without any other frameworks) for the purpose of brushing up on the aforementioned programming languages.

<br>

* **Random Tools** (Link to tool: <https://emman-b.github.io/random-tools/>) (Github: <https://github.com/Emman-B/random-tools>)
    - Technologies Used: React (create-react-app), Material-UI, Git
> This is a web app that contains a few tools for randomization (e.g., generating a random number, randomizing a list of items). I was the sole developer of this web app. The main technologies I used to develop this are React and Material-UI for React.
