I'm Emmanuel Butor. Welcome to my portfolio. You can find my work on Github on either my personal account, [Emman-B](https://github.com/emman-b), or my school account [ebutor](https://github.com/ebutor).

## About Me
I like to program a variety of things for fun, whether they are simple web apps or full games in Unity. The reason for the variety is because I find the aspect of learning new software technologies to be interesting.

Languages I've worked with:
* C/C++
* C#
* Javascript
* Java
* Python

Technologies I've worked with:
* Unity: Game Development
* React: Web App Development
* Git: Version Control
  * I used the command line for Git quite often, but I am learning the Github Desktop App for Git.
* PERN Stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Nodejs for Full-Stack Web Development
  * Using the PERN stack was done in a university class with a strict rule on uploading code publicly, so I cannot show the repository with this technology in use.



## Projects

Here is a list of projects that I have worked on, either with a team or on my own. This is not an exhaustive list of all of the things I have worked on. If you want a more thorough list, please refer to my Github accounts.

<br>

* **D&D DM Toolset** (Github: <https://github.com/matthewfritsch/DND-DM-Toolset>)
  * Technologies Used: Unity, Git, NUnit Testing (integrated with Unity)
  * Languages Used: C#
> This is a toolset developed in Unity for Dungeons & Dragons, designed to assist Dungeon Masters. I was one of the key developers working on implementing functionality for some of the components, such as the component for searching for and selecting from a list of monsters. During the development of this software, I was on a team that practiced the Scrum project management framework.

<br>

* **Together in Spirit** (Game link: <https://togetherinspirit.itch.io/>) (Github: <https://github.com/dyzhang16/CS170Project>)
  * Technologies Used: Unity, Git
  * Languages Used: C#
> This is a narrative-driven game built in Unity. My role in this project was programmer for the team, and I worked on some of the game system functionality as well as helped with incorporating finalized assets (from other departments) into the game. Examples of things I worked on were the Basketball minigame, Coffee Recipe Book functionality, and some of the cutscenes.

<br>

* **stage_fright** (Github: <https://github.com/jnkrupp/stage-fright>) (Devpost: <https://devpost.com/software/stage_fright>)
  * Technologies Used: Unity, Git, Flask, IBM Watson
  * Languages Used: C#, Python
> This was an entry in the CruzHacks 2019 Hackathon where we devloped an app to help with alleviating stage fright during public speaking. My role with this project was developing the VR space to simulate speaking in front of a live audience. This entry won a few of the awards in the hackathon ("Tech Cares" and "UCSC Arts").

<br>

* **GBF Spark Calculator** (Link to tool: <https://emman-b.github.io/gbf-sparks/>) (Github: <https://github.com/Emman-B/gbf-sparks>)
  * Technologies Used: Github Pages, Git
  * Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JS
> This is a tool for calculating "sparks" in the mobile game Granblue Fantasy. I was the sole developer of this tool. The tool was developed by writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript by hand (i.e., without any other frameworks) for the purpose of brushing up on the aforementioned programming languages.

<br>

* **Random Tools** (Link to tool: <https://emman-b.github.io/random-tools/>) (Github: <https://github.com/Emman-B/random-tools>)
  * Technologies Used: React (create-react-app), Material-UI, Git, Github Pages
  * Languages Used: JSX (for React)
> This is a web app that contains a few tools for randomization (e.g., generating a random number, randomizing a list of items). I was the sole developer of this web app. The main technologies I used to develop this are React and Material-UI for React.

<br>

* **Dynamic Memory Allocation Tracker** (Github: <https://github.com/Emman-B/dymat-c>)
  * Technologies Used: `valgrind` (for checking memory leaks)
  * Languages Used: C
> This is a program written in C that tracks memory heap allocations (specifically allocations that use `malloc` and `calloc`) using a hash table. The hash table was created by having an array of linked lists, where hash collisions are handled by appending to the list. The user is able to clear all tracked heap allocations by calling a single function, ensuring that there are no memory leaks.
